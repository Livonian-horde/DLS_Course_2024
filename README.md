# My Homework for Deep Learning School (МФТИ)

Welcome to the repository with my solutions to problems from the courses organized by MIPT [Deep Learning School](https://github.com/DLSchool). Different ventures and assignments related to deep learning. Originated from course on stepik Deep Learning (semester 1, fall 2024) https://stepik.org/course/212774/syllabus

## Repository structure


- **[Task 1](./HW1_Introduction_to_pandas_matplotlib_sklearn)** - Fundamentals of machine learning. Introduction to pandas, matplotlib, sklearn. In this homework, we walked through the complete machine learning framework using the sklearn library.
- **[Task 2](./HW2_Linear_models_and_optimization_methods)** - Linear models and optimization methods. In this homeworkt, we wrote logistic regression and logistic regression with regularization
- **[Task 3](./HW3_Machine_Learning_Competition)** - A competition with predicting the customer's departure from the bank. In this homework, we solved the applied problem of data analysis using machine learning methods. The homework is structured like a Kaggle competition.
- **[Task 4](./HW4_Convolutional_and_Fully_connected_neural_networks)** - Convolutional and fully connected neural networks. In this homework assignment, we practice learning neural networks using the Pytorch library.
- **[Task 5](./HW5_Classification_of_the_Simpsons)** - Classification of the Simpsons. In this homework, we solved another contest on Kaggle again. This time, the images of characters from the Simpsons were classified.
- **[Task 6](./HW6_Semantic_Segmentation)** - Semantic Segmentation. In this homework assignment, we solved the problem of segmentation of medical images.
